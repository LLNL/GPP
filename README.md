## Generative Patch Priors (GPP) for self calibrated (SC) compressive sensing

#### TODO
* GPP compare to TVAL3, DIP, ReconNet on standard images (establishes how good GPP is)
* GPP vs Specific GANs like CelebA to establish upper bound on quality of image recovery
* SC and GPP, SC and DIP to show GPP degrades better with fewer measurements (speed v DIP)
* SC for non-linear forward processes which do not have closed form — requires a mimicGAN like formulation
* SC on real dataset from ReconNet to show the use of proposed generic approach
* SC + GPP on other inverse problems — CT Reconstruction/High dynamic range imaging/phase retrieval
